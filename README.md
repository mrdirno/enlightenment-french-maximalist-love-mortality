## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character from the Comte's salon (Solange, Armand, Dr. Verrat) visits Élodie's windmill, attempting to persuade or confront her.
- Compose a 'lost chapter' detailing the love story of the laundress and the guardsman, from first meeting to fatal news.
- Draft a letter from Lucien to the Comte, written midway through the novel, where his cynical philosophy first shows signs of fracture.
- Imagine a sequel scene, five years later, where a now-changed Lucien encounters a new, young cynic in the Comte's latest salon.

### Technical Entry Points

- Create a 'Sorrow Scale' interactive web experience that visually weighs different emotional traumas as physical organs, using the novel's 412-gram heart as a baseline.
- Build a 'Light Autopsy' tool that allows users to upload an image and apply a CSS/JS filter that mimics the 'dissecting' Parisian light from Chapter 1, highlighting texture and flaw.

## Origin

Generated through persona500's Council-Prism Generation.
SASI evaluation: 8/10

Council: Marquis de Sade (transgressive materialism, the body as site of truth), Madame de Staël (passion as intellectual and moral force, the salon culture), William Blake (spiritual anatomy, the marriage of heaven and hell in the human form), Denis Diderot (encyclopedic detail, the tension between sensation and reason)
